<hr/>

## About

This project is an simplified Steam game deal tracker. Your task is to implement this project using data from a Rest API.

The main purpose of this challenge is not evaluate the candidates' knowledge of react native or front-end development but to show us how they solve a problem and how they study for it.

The candidates should think this challenge as their first task working at Taqtile, so what they delivery in this challenge is what we would expect from their work in a real project given the same constraints.

## TODOs

- [ ] Use a FlatList component in Search.js;
- [ ] Implement all styles with `styled-components`
- [ ] Create the searchbar and the list using the provided [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/r61jkxnhBrO5nUG7jyqX0O/cheapshark---steam-(Copy)) as reference;
- [ ] Use the [List of Deals API from CheapSharkAPI](https://apidocs.cheapshark.com/#b9b738bf-2916-2a13-e40d-d05bccdce2ba) to search the deals;
- [ ] The searchbar must allow the user to search by name and filter by min and max price;
- [ ] The list itens must contain: the game title, an image, the retail price, the discounted price and the metacritic score

## General guidelines

The candidates' solution is not required to be exactly equal to the provided Figma design. It should be only be used as an example of what atributes are desired to be found on the details page.

We ask for the candidates to *do not* share their final code to their classmates or to ask for others the solution of this challenge. The candidate is more than welcome to ask us for any doubts or problems, discuss possible solutions with their colleagues and share interesting references with them.

The candidates should send us their final solution in format of a Snack in their account. 

The candidates should send us the references they used to complete the challenge in the file **references.txt**. A solution without the references will be considered incomplete.

## Tips

- Double-check the version of the library's documentation you are reading. The web version of Expo does not support the latest version of all libraries we are using in this challenge, therefore we set up this project using some known working ones..

- You only need to list the deals from [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) (storeID=1), which is the largest online computer gaming store

## About Expo

Open the `App.js` file to start writing some code. You can preview the changes directly on your phone or tablet by clicking the **Run** button or use the simulator by clicking **Tap to Play**. When you're done, click **Save** and share the link!

When you're ready to see everything that Expo provides (or if you want to use your own editor) you can **Export** your project and use it with [expo-cli](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/installation.html).

All projects created in Snack are publicly available, so you can easily share the link to this project via link, or embed it on a web page with the **Embed** button.

If you're having problems, you can tweet to us [@expo](https://twitter.com/expo) or ask in our [forums](https://forums.expo.io).

Snack is Open Source. You can find the code on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/expo/snack-web).
